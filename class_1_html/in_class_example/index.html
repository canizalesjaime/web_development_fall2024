        They decided to find the end of the rainbow.
        &lt;br&lt;
        <br/>
        While they hoped they would find a pot of gold,
         neither of them truly believed that the mythical pot would actually be there. 
         <br/>Nor did they believe they could actually find the end of the rainbow.
         <br/> Still, it seemed like a fun activity for the day, and pictures of them chasing rainbows would look great on their Instagram accounts. 
         <br/>They would have never believed they would actually find the end of a rainbow, and when they did, what they actually found there.
